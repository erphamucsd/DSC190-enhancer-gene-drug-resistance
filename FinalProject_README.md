#Data
The scRNA and scChIP folders contain compressed files for the scRNA-seq and scChIP-seq data respectively.
The data was originally aquired from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE117309

The dge_scRNA/ChIP_seq.ipynb files are the python notebooks that were used to analyze the data.
The dge_scRNA/ChIP_seq_genes.csv files contain the differentially expressed and regulated genes with other information like p-value.
